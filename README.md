I created this repo today with an ambition shared by many others: to model the financial markets. I have long ruminated how this should be carefully done and whether to do it privately or openly. My decision for the second choice can be seen now. I won't and perhaps couldn't explain the full complex reasoning behind (the analysis essentially requires valuing a few real options). But one reason is openly doing this gives me a behavioral boost. 
For this project, the deliveries will come as natural as possible. There is no product owner keeping a backlog of features. The goals should be iteratively obvious and for the majority manifest from usage.
